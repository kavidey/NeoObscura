# New Hardware
The main new piece of hardware we're using is a custom designed image sensor (pictured below)

![Camera Sensor]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/sensor.png)

The sensor PCB contains a 30x40 array of 1200 phototransistors along with a 32:1 analog mux (used for selecting rows) and two mezzanine connectors (50 pins each) for communication. The sensor is connected to a breadboard with a 48:1 analog mux (used for selecting columns). The analog muxes (controlled by the MCU) are used to select a single phototransistor to read from by applying voltage to the corresponding column and reading the output voltage from the corresponding row. The phototransistor is setup in a common collector configuration with a XX k resistor between the emitter and ground.
<!-- TODO: enter correct resistor value -->

The phototransistors and muxes are all run on 5V. Note that the sensor PCB theoretically supports any 0805 phototransistor, but we are using the [PT0805CS](https://www.alibaba.com/product-detail/0805-SMD-Phototransistor-PT0805CS-Photosensor-Photosensitive_1600907962335.html) due to its low cost and availability. See schematics for the sensor PCB [here](#sensor-pcb).


The new MCU peripheral we are using is the ADC which reads analog signals (in this case from the phototransistors in the sensor) and converts them to a digital signal.

# Schematics
<!-- Include images of the schematics for your system. They should follow best practices for schematic drawings with all parts and pins clearly labeled. You may draw your schematics either with a software tool or neatly by hand. -->

# Inspiration
The inspiration for this project came from a simlar project found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaXweP73NT4).

We aim to expland on this project by making it higher resolution, adding a bayer filter for color imagery, and adding on-device image compression.
